MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STR={mongo db connection string}
MONGO_DB_NAME={the mongo db database name}
```

Exmaple
```Å¡
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=taxAdmin
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=topsecret
MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STR=mongodb://txtAdmin:topsecret@192.168.1.123:27017/taxCalculator
MONGO_DB_NAME=taxCalculator
```
# To run the project locally

1. Make sure you have setup the environment variables in prerequisite section
2. Navigate to middleware folder, execute the following command to spin up the mongo db
```console
docker compose up
```
3. Navigate to the top level of the project, execute the following command
```console
sam build && sam local start-api
```
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/tax/{amount} to get the tax of the amount provided

   ## Example: 
   http://localhost:3000/tax/52000.00?detail

  { Rate: 20, UpperBound: 50000, Description: "Basic Rate" },
  { Rate: 40, UpperBound: 150000, Description: "Higher Rate" },
  { Rate: 45, Description: "Additional Rate" },
]
```
- if you want to modify them, navigate to http://localhost:8081 and login with the username and password you set in the environment variables in prerequisite section.
